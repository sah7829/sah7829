Welcome to my Github!
I primarily use this to transfer files between my laptop and personal computer (which are mostly private files) but I also love using Github pages. 
You may notice a few repositories with urls, I create new Github accounts in order to get a more personalized url depending on what I'm working on (don't tell them 😝)
I also use Gitlab in a few of my Software Engineering classes.

You can reach me at: Skyler0herman@gmail.com
I'm always looking for opportunities to grow as a Software Engineer and expand my knowledge.
