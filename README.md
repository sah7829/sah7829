Welcome to my Github!

I'm a Fourth Year at RIT majoring in Software Engineering. While programming and working with software are definitely some of my passions - I balance myself out by doing Taekwondo, which I am a second degree Black Belt in, and engaging in performing arts such as musical theater and straight plays.
I primarily use this to transfer files between my laptop and personal computer (which are mostly private files) but I also love using Github pages. 
You may notice a few repositories with urls, I create new Github accounts in order to get a more personalized url depending on what I'm working on (don't tell them 😝)
I also use Gitlab in a few of my Software Engineering classes.

You can reach me at: Skyler0herman@gmail.com. I'm always looking for opportunities to grow as a Software Engineer and expand my knowledge. And be sure to check out my website @ https://skylerherman.com !
